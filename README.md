## ðŸš€ Java 24 Features - Overview  

Java 24 brings exciting improvements in performance, memory management, and developer productivity. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the key features:  

### ðŸ”¹ **Performance & Memory Management**  
- **Generational Shenandoah GC (Experimental)** â€“ Optimizes memory usage by dividing objects into young and old generations, reducing CPU overhead.  
- **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Class Loading** â€“ Improves startup time by preloading classes before execution.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Stream API Enhancements**  
- **Stream Gatherers (Preview)** â€“ Enables flexible, stateful, and grouped data processing within streams.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Language Improvements**  
- **Implicitly Declared Classes & Instance Main Method (Preview)** â€“ Allows simpler class and main method declarations for quick experimentation.  
- **Constructor Flexibility** â€“ Provides more options for constructor definitions, making object creation smoother.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Cryptography & Security**  
- **Stronger Encryption Support** â€“ Enhancements in security algorithms to meet modern cryptographic standards.  

### ðŸ”¹ **General Enhancements**  
- **Better Memory Management** â€“ Reduces GC pause times and improves application responsiveness.  
- **Optimized Class Loading & Linking** â€“ Faster startup and reduced runtime overhead.  

ðŸ”¹ **Java 24 continues to improve performance, efficiency, and developer experience.** ðŸš€
